Compendinator
=============

So if you're like me, you're paying ten bucks a month for access to Wizards of
the Coast's pretty neat "DDI" service, which gives D&D players tons of cool
content and features. It's well worth it, except for one thing: it's a real pain
in the ass to get any data out of it.

They provide an API, but it's incredibly undocumented and ridiculously difficult
to access in the first place when compared to other APIs (you basically need to
trick the API into thinking that you're browsing from the website). With
Compendinator, the power is back in your hands; you can sign in with your DDI
credentials and download the data to do what you see fit with it.


Usage
-----

Compendinator is still very early in development, so it doesn't do a whole lot
just yet. For now, you can enter your DDI e-mail address and password, click
"Sign In," and you'll be "signed into" DDI through their terrible, horrible API.
You can also download the list of all monsters by clicking "Retrieve List" under
the "Monsters" section of the ribbon. You don't have to be signed in to do this,
and it doesn't do much other than download a file.

Eventually, the downloaded monster list will be loaded into the program, with a
checkbox next to each name. You can check or uncheck any or all of the monsters,
then click some button and Compendinator will download and export the data from
the monsters you've chosen.

*Eventually* eventually, you'll be able to do the same for items traps, and
maybe eventually other stuff, who knows.


About
-----

Compendinator is for Windows only at the moment, but it shouldn't be too hard to
port it elsewhere. It's still in the kind of early phases of development, but
progress is being made rapidly.
